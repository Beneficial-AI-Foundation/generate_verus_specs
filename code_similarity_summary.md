# Code Similarity Analysis Summary for benches Directory

## Executive Summary

I analyzed 2,396 functions across 986 Rust/Verus files in the `benches` directory to identify functions with different names but similar implementations. Here are the key findings:

### Overall Statistics

- **34.6% of functions** (829 out of 2,396) have at least one similar counterpart
- **157 groups** of similar functions were identified
- **Similarity threshold**: 75% or higher

### Similarity Breakdown

| Similarity Level | Groups | Functions | Description |
|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 100% (Exact) | 6 | 49 | Identical implementations |
| 95-99% | 9 | 76 | Near-identical with minor differences |
| 90-94% | 17 | 137 | Same algorithm, small variations |
| 85-89% | 35 | 242 | Same approach, moderate variations |
| 80-84% | 46 | 201 | Related implementations |
| 75-79% | 44 | 124 | Shared patterns |

### Key Patterns Identified

#### 1. **Stub Functions (Group 5)**
- **38 functions** with identical stub implementations
- All in `VerusProofSynthesisBench/MBPP_no_bodies/`
- Pattern: `return Vec::new(); // TODO: Remove this line and implement the function body`
- Examples: `shared_elements`, `replace_with_colon`, `find_odd_numbers`, etc.

#### 2. **Specification vs Implementation Pairs**
- Multiple cases of `_spec` functions paired with their implementations
- Example: `three_distinct_spec` and `three_distinct` (100% identical)
- Found in HumanEval-RustBench benchmarks

#### 3. **Recursive Function Variants**
- Group 8: 9 variations of `min_rcur`/`max_rcur` across different directories
- Similar recursive patterns with minor differences in implementation

#### 4. **Cross-Directory Duplicates**
- **66 groups** contain functions duplicated across different benchmark suites
- Most common between:
  - `VerusProofSynthesisBench` and `autoverus`
  - `HumanEval-RustBench` and `autoverus`

### Directory Distribution

| Directory | Functions with Duplicates | Analysis |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|
| artifacts | 240 | Highest duplication, likely generated code |
| VerusProofSynthesisBench | 225 | Many stub functions and templates |
| autoverus | 221 | Verified/unverified variants of same functions |
| HumanEval-RustBench | 96 | Spec/implementation pairs |
| RustBench | 47 | Least duplication |

### Notable Large Groups

1. **Group 5**: 38 stub functions (100% identical) - all unimplemented function bodies
2. **Group 124**: 45 functions (77.9% similar) - various arithmetic and list operations
3. **Group 20**: 26 functions (81.4% similar) - recursive counting/filtering patterns

### Recommendations

1. **Consolidate Stub Functions**: The 38 identical stub functions in `MBPP_no_bodies` could use a common template or macro

2. **Extract Common Patterns**: Functions with 90%+ similarity could benefit from:
   - Shared utility functions
   - Generic implementations
   - Common trait implementations

3. **Review Cross-Directory Duplicates**: 66 groups span multiple directories, suggesting opportunities for:
   - Creating a shared library
   - Standardizing implementations
   - Reducing maintenance overhead

4. **Template Detection**: Large similar groups (10+ functions) likely indicate:
   - Code generation patterns
   - Systematic benchmark creation
   - Opportunities for parameterized tests

### Impact

- **Maintenance**: ~35% of functions have duplicates, increasing maintenance burden
- **Testing**: Similar implementations might benefit from shared test infrastructure
- **Performance**: Consolidated implementations could improve compilation times

This analysis reveals significant code duplication in the benchmark suite, with clear patterns that could be addressed through refactoring and better code organization.
